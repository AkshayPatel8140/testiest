This will be a hands-on experience following a patient's journey from the lens of the data, using a unique dataset created for this specialization.We will review how the different choices you make -- such as those around feature construction, the data types to use, how the model evaluation is set up and how you handle the patient timeline -- affect the care that would be recommended by the model.\n",
